## Background

Bhutan developer community as it sounds is a community, powered by Bhutanese who are tech enthusiasts, programmers, coders, designers, and citizens interested in technology. The community is the first of its kind in the country. Open Source is a source code that is made freely available for possible modifications and redistribution. Bhutan as of January 2022, does not have a single open-source project. Bhutan Developer community looks into the community as huge scope for nurturing one another and a path for contributing to the global community of open-source projects.

Bhutan currently lacks a platform for Bhutanese in the ICT sector in sharing knowledge and skills, which doesn't enable the doers to come together to work on projects for the community. With it, there has been a huge gap between the community requirement and skill set that most Bhutanese possess. Simpler tasks are still performed manually when a smart systematic application could save time and money. Entrepreneurship has always been difficult in the country despite the number of entrepreneurs coming in. With population comes the market and for Bhutanese entrepreneur to expand to the international market seem almost impossible. Could a better system internally resolve many of the issues?

The Bhutan Developer community involving members from various ICT sectors in the country with different skill sets, the community will gradually grow to be a knowledge pool assisting members of the community and others in mitigating current issues. Young minds will be automatically groomed in having improved or new skill sets to work in a team and would get easier for them to feed the requirements of the job market. In a community with members possessing skills at different levels, learning and nurturing one another becomes easier. The community aims in breaking the barrier of not being able to sell Bhutanese skillsets beyond our country and be appreciated by all the stakeholders in the country.



#### Why open-source?

The community will remain open-source welcoming any Bhutanese willing to learn and grow together and to contribute to the development of open-source projects. Open source projects are open to anybody who wants to contribute and improve the project, the community members will be able to contribute despite where they are based in adding new features and tackling errors unlike the traditional form of the project development process where the team is blamed/reported if there is any issue with the system. Open source projects make communication easier, usage of the version control system such as Git, project management, documentation and leadership.
