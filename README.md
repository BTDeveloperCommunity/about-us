## Mission

<!-- Rough / Brainstroming -->

- To create a platform for people to work together

- Build projects to address and solve the current problems in the society through ICT and community eco-system

- To groom and nuture learners with proper skill set to cater the needs of digital eco-system




## Background

#### Problem statement

- Lack of platform for bhutanese ICT sector to share knowledge and work on projects for the community

- Huge gap between the community requirement and the skill set that our young generation posess

- Ease of many simpler tasks are still being manually performed when a smart systematic application could save millions

<!-- This sentence needs some restructuring -->

- Slow growth of startup companies being stepping stone for the well established company

- Entrepreneurship being a difficult journey in the country due to the existence of numerous policies

- Limited market in the country and unable to step out to the international market


#### How can the community solve it

<!-- This sentence needs some restructuring -->

- With the community involving ICT from various skill sets, the community will gradually grow to be a knowledge pool assisting all members and others to mitigate current ICT issues or hinderances

- Grooming the young minds to have adequate skill sets to work in teams and to fit the requirements of the job market

- Having a proper mentor, enthusiastic learners will be able to improve their particular skillsets

- As a community, we hope to give confidence to the policy makers and other stake holders to appreciate and support the ICT communtity and young entrepreneurs.

- This community aims to break the barrier of not being able to sell Bhutanese skill sets beyond our country and appreciated by all the stake holders in the country


#### Why open-source? 

- We aim to keep our community as open-source so that anyone can learn and contribute to the developemnt of the projects

- To decentralize the developement so that addition of new features and tackling errors can be contributed by anyone rather than reporting it to a particular developer.

- Learn various team work skills like communication, usage of version control systems like Git, collaborate on GitHub, project management, documentation, and leadership.
